# Rock-Papers-Scissors
A mini-game of Rock Paper Scissors that you will be playing against the computer!
In this project I want to make good practice of using arrow functions + usage of DOM manipulations. 

The game consits in you playing a classic game of Rock Paper and Scissors, you will be playing against the calculator who makes random choice, the first one to get to 5 wins wins the game! After 5 wins the game will reset and you can play again!
